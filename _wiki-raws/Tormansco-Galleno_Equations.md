The **Tormansco-Galleno Equations** are a series of equation that are
utilized by [clairvoyants](Clairvoyance "wikilink") in order to predict
long-term phenomena in society. The Equations were discovered by
[Tormansco the Oracle](Tormansco_the_Oracle "wikilink") and Datamage
[Galleno](Galleno "wikilink") in the late 20th century

## The Tormansco-Galleno Equation of Societal Clairvoyancy

## The Tormansco Equation

The **Tormansco Equation** also known as the **Tormansco Score** is an
equation formulated by Tormansco following inaccuracies in the
predictions of the Tormansco-Galleno Equation. Once filled in, the
equation gives a value that is used to correct the Tormansco-Galleno
Equation. Due to how the Equation works, the number is sometimes called
the "Tormansco Universe Number" or TUN and can be used to determine
universal deviation from a hypothetical non-clairvoyant standard.
