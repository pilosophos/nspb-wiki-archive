**Andeijan**, also known as Malaszec Feyspeech, is a language in the
Southern Malaszec branch of the [Malaszec language
family](Languages_in_Malaszec#Malaszec_language_family "wikilink"). It
is spoken mainly as a second language among faeries in southern
Malaszec. It is unusual in that it makes use of whistled consonants,
which is said to have evolved in Andeijan to provide better contrast for
sounds made by faeries.

## Phonology

### Consonants

Andeijan's phonology is notable for its whistled fricatives, which also
have a voiced/unvoiced distinction while the non-whistled consonants
don't. In order to accommodate the whistling articulation, the
fricatives which are labiodental in other Malaszec languages are
bilabial in Andeijan. Andeijan is believed to have evolved its whistled
consonants in order to better distinguish between phonemes that sound
similar in Proto-Malaszec when produced by a faerie. Consonants that are
not whistled have no distinction between voicing and voicelessness for
the same reason. The voiceless Proto-Malaszec \*/q/ is thought to have
become voiced and trilled /ʀ/, also distinguishing it from /g/.

## Nouns

### Evidentiality

In contrast to languages in the Northern Malaszec language family,
Southern Malaszec languages (including Andeijan) have grammatical
evidentiality for nouns. [Oneirologist](Oneirology "wikilink") Nal
Kaskij suggests that evidentiality in these languages evolved to better
describe the uncertainty and complexity of dreams, which occur more
vividly in southeast Malaszec due to elevated atmospheric mana. In
Andeijan, noun evidentiality marks certainty and/or reasoning about the
identity or existence of the noun in context.

- **Neutral** evidentiality conveys no particular degree of uncertainty.
- **Apparent** evidentiality indicates the identity or existence of the
  noun is known, but the reason why is unclear. Often used when
  describing a speaker's intuition.



(ex. "I met <u>someone who was apparently an uncle</u>." Here, the head
word is "uncle." In Andeijan, The entire underlined phrase would be
rendered into one noun with an evidentiality marker.)

- **Inferential** evidentiality indicates that the identity or existence
  of the noun is known for a reason.



(ex. "<u>A UFO, which it must have been,</u> landed." Here, the head
word is "UFO." No reason is given, but it is implied the speaker has
one.)

- **Reportative** evidentiality indicates the identity or existence of
  the noun is hearsay or implied by someone else. It is also used to
  report knowledge from a hazy memory belonging to the speaker, which
  can be considered a speaker's "past self".



(ex. "Alice talked to <u>someone, who I heard was Bob</u>." Here, the
head word is "Bob.")

- **Incognitive** evidentiality indicates the identity or existence of
  the noun is unclear and in doubt. In this case, the head noun might
  only be a guess or suggestion as to what it might actually be.



(ex. "He leaned the carton against a <u>rock or something</u>." Here,
the head word is "rock." The thing that the carton leaned on might have
been a rock, but the speaker doesn't know for sure.)
