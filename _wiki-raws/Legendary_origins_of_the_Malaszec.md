Various mythical origin stories exist regarding the origin of the
Malaszec people. Of these, the most well known is the legend of the
lightning.

## The Legend of the Lightning

> Legend has it that the lightning first struck the ground in the plains
> of Malaszec thousands of years ago. In an instant, the lightning came
> and went, leaving in its wake a dancing fire. And the ground, startled
> by this, began to cry. In the day, it cried and in the night, it
> quaked. From its crying formed the first mighty rivers. From its
> quakes formed magnificent rifts, and the energy beneath the ground
> escaped and became life. Animals drank of the water and feared the
> fire, but of all the creatures who came from the ground, three were
> brave, and approached the fire with caution but without fear. These
> three creatures the human, the faerie, and the elf.
>
> The creatures huddled around the fire, and with the animals afraid of
> it, was kept safe from their wildness and violence. When the lightning
> returned from the heavens and saw the three creatures, the lightning
> smiled and proclaimed, "You who do not fear the fire shall be my
> heirs. When I have gone at last, you will inherit all of the fire."
> And he named the heirs Malaszec, for they were the bravest among all
> creatures.
>
> By day, the Malaszec walked to the rivers for water. By night, they
> huddled and cooked food around the fire. And thusly they did this for
> many months, but did tire of the ceaseless journeys. One day, the
> human spoke to the other Malaszecs, "Why do we not move the fire?" And
> the elf replied, "This fire is not yet ours to move. Would the
> lightning not be angry?" Contemplating this, the human and the elf
> decided not to move the fire.
>
> But the faerie remained unconvinced, and in the night prepared the
> fire to be moved while all the world was sleeping. When all was ready,
> the faerie awoke the other Malaszecs, who saw what the faerie had done
> and protested. Then argued the faerie, "We fear not the fire, yet why
> do we fear the lightning? Has he not said that the fire was to be ours
> when he is gone?" And the two others began to reconsider. "Where is
> the lightning now? What right does the lightning have to deny us our
> inheritance, for you see that he is gone?" asked the faerie, "The
> night is quiet, and the lightning too is at rest. Make haste, and we
> can move this fire by daybreak." The elf and the human nodded, and now
> deciding not to let the faerie's labour to waste, brought the fire to
> the riverbank by daybreak.
>
> When the lightning came from the heavens to torment the ground once
> again as he often did, he saw that the fire had been moved. The
> lightning became angry, and confronted the Malaszec at the riverbank.
> "Why have you moved the fire?" asked the lighting, "I did not say that
> it could be moved!"
>
> And the human replied, "But you said the fire was to be ours when you
> were gone at last!"
>
> The lightning thundered, "Yet you see that I am here before you, and
> you see that I am not gone at last!"
>
> Then the faerie countered, "Ah, but when we had moved the fire, you
> had gone since at last we saw you."
>
> "What games you play faerie! You hear my words, and yet you throw away
> the meaning!" thundered the lightning once again, "And you, human and
> elf, how dare you give your aid! I cast you away, the lot of you! A
> fool I was to trust you, to call you brave and promise you the fire!"
>
> And with these words, he struck the ground a thousand times over, and
> in its wake a mighty wildfire which swept across the land. The
> Malaszecs ran in all directions: the faerie to the south, the human to
> the north, and the elf to the west. And when they had become weary
> from their running, the ground grew for them trees and caves for
> shelter, for the lightning had tormented the ground so long that it
> was no longer afraid.
>
> To each, the human, the faerie, and the elf, the ground gave all that
> she had to offer. The lightning struck and struck, leaving fires in
> its wake, but the Malaszecs were kept safe and sustained by the
> ground. And in time, the brave Malaszecs acquired even wisdom, and
> could produce their own fire in defiance of the lightning.
