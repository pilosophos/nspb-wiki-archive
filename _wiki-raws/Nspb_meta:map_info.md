This page contains OOC info about the map, which was initially
computer-generated at the start of the project.

## Greyscale heightmap

All three channels (RGB) are the same. The lowest point above sea level
is 90 and the highest is 100.

Each interval of 5 RGB = 700 metres elevation. On the RGB heightmap:

- 90 RGB corresponds to 0-700 metres above sea level
- 95 RGB : 700-1400 m
- 100 RGB : 1400-2100 m

These values were determined by Lerh on 1 January 2020 in
\#great_nspb_canon for creating the climate zones.

## Climate map

The climate regions map is pinned to \#great_nspb_canon.
