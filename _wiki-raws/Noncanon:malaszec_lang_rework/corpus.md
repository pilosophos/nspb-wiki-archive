## Bound morphemes (must keep)

### Function morphemes

- Nouns
  - -NULL: 3.AGENTIVE
  - -asze: 2.PATIENTIVE
  - -a: 3.PATIENTIVE
  - -ije: POSS for non-Andeijan nouns. Grammaticalized item borrowed
    from Andeijan. Only for definite/proper nouns in old version, but
    maybe we should generalize? Should we make this a clitic?
- Verbs
  - -NULL: PERFV.NPST.INDICATIVE
  - -nik: OPTATIVE
  - -jan: NMLZ

### Content morphemes

- -kan derivational suffix forming adjectives from verbs. Having essence
  or quality of the verb. (rom-kan "seeming busy" or something like
  that?). Also derivational suffix for business due to other etymology
  (clipping from kasosposz)
- -posz: Honorific title used by Chamber of Commerce members and senior
  officers of companies amongst each other.
- -os: derivational suffix for metals (maybe make more general? Tool
  making materials? What is its etymology?)

## Observations

- Simple compounds where left-aligned morphemes modify right-aligned
  morphemes are common (this feature will be required). Components tend
  to be free morphemes (but it would not hurt to introduce bound ones).
  The final morpheme determines PoS (but this is also not required).
- Ajl (ADV "no, none" or NUMERAL "none, zero") tends to be used
  prohibitively in optative/imperative sentences. (Should there be
  special syntax for NPIs?)
- Bare counter usage is attested to indicate specificity (fos ajnalasze
  "that fool").
- Sentence final particles are NOT attested (candidate for
  replacement?).
- Copula omission attested when it would otherwise be unmarked
  (be\PERFV.NPST.INDICATIVE).
- Malaszec is a Postpositions / Numeral-Noun / SOV / Case suffixes (2nd
  most popular typology in
  [WALS](https://wals.info/combinations/85A_89A_81A_51A#2/26.2/153.0);
  explore further)

### Phonology

- Free morpheme roots have no consonant final requirement. The same
  vowel across morpheme boundaries (e.g. ajnala + asze) will be reduced
  to normal length. (Need to figure out morpho-phonological rules for
  morpheme boundaries).
- c and k have same reading /k/ (historical convergence?)
- /h/ deletion in environments attested: k_e
