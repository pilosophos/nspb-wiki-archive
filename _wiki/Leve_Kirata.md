## Myth

Summarized from the Annals of Creation:

> In the long gone past the hero Leve Kirata claimed the fires of wealth
> and creation from the gods of sky and for that sin the tribe of elves
> were exiled from the first garden into the endless plains. There it
> was said they would wander forever and never know rest or safety.
>
> But Leve Kirata would not be content with eternal punishment. He
> promised his people that he would bring them to a home, a true home.
> To this goal he led the elven people in the wake of the moving sun for
> one month and then ordered them to stop. Where they had stopped he
> took the fire of creation and drew a scorched line in the sand. The
> people asked why he had drawn this line and he proclaimed it would be
> the border of their land in this endless place and then bade his
> people to turn around with him and walk the same path again against
> the sun.
>
> So the people packed their things and began their long march again.
> But before a day had passed an emissary of the sky gods appeared
> before them. “To march the same way in the endless land is foolish. If
> you follow the command of Leve Kirata it is death you will find.” But
> the people trusted Leve Kirata and marched past the emissary and
> continued east for one month. When they finally reached their goal
> they saw him waiting for them, still with the fires of creation in one
> hand.
>
> “Because you have trusted me, now our people shall flourish. All this
> way I have followed you and brought the fires of wealth to the land I
> have staked out to be ours, letting life overtake the wasteland. With
> this line drawn now I will have marked the border of our land, that
> will be forever our land, so that dead lands can never overtake it.”
>
> Leve Kirata then drew a line in sand with the fires of creation and to
> the astonishment of the elves all the land beyond the line sank down
> and became water, a great blue ocean. All land beyond the two lines
> that Leve Kirata had drawn became the sea and between them the desert
> now teemed with life. The elves settled here and called their home
> Erothena, the land of fire.
