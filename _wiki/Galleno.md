Galleno was a [Datamage](datamancy "wikilink"), Engineer, and Logician
who is famous for implementing
[Tormansco](Tormansco_the_Oracle "wikilink")'s theories with
revolutionary mathematical advancements and equally revolutionary
devices. Although he wouldn't live to see an
[Oracle](Clairvoyance "wikilink") that could handle the
Tormansco-Galleno equation, his designs would prove critical for the
creation of the first Grand Oracle in //Nation//.
