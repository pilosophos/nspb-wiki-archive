*This page is about the Malaszec language and its grammar. For its
vocabulary, see [Malaszec vocabulary](Malaszec_vocabulary "wikilink")*

The **Malaszec language** is primarily spoken by the people living in
[Malaszec](Malaszec "wikilink") and Malaszec communities overseas. The
Malaszec Industrial Standards Board regulates and promotes the usage of
Industrial Standard Malaszec (often simply called "Malaszec"), which is
the official language of Malaszec. Malaszec is a part of the Northern
Malaszec branch of the Malaszec family of languages, and is influenced
by Andeijan, a Southern Malaszec language spoken primarily by faeries.
The political history of the country of Malaszec has affected various
language features. One such feature is the personal pronouns that were
dropped from Old Malaszec, replaced by dozens of nouns that marked
person during the feudalistic Malaszec Empires, and reduced considerably
during the Communist era. In modern times, Malaszec is the dominant
language in the country for all demographics, human or otherwise, and is
needed for doing business and conversing with others.

Malaszec consonant phonemes

### Vowels

|           | Front | Back |
|-----------|-------|------|
| Close     | i ɪ   |      |
| Close-mid | e     | o    |
| Open-mid  | ɛ     | ɔ    |
| Open      |       | ɒ    |

Malaszec monophthong phonemes

Only /ɒ, ɛ, i, o/ are allowed as the first vowel of a word. The minimal
set of distinctive features needed to target each phoneme in Malaszec
consists of front, low, and high.

#### Vowel harmony

All vowels except the first vowel and the open back vowel ⫽ɒ⫽ in a word
are underspecified for Advanced Tongue Root (ATR). When phonemically
realised, the underspecified vowels agree in ATR with the first vowel of
the word, meaning that the entire word has +ATR vowel harmony
(traditionally known as "light" harmony) and -ATR harmony ("dark"
harmony). Underspecified vowels are typically represented by capital
letters in the underlying representation, with the featural
specifications in the following table. As the first vowel in a word, /ɒ/
is considered -ATR for dark harmony.

### Phonological rules

The phonological rules of Malaszec are presented in order of
application:

1\. Harmony resolution


Underspecified vowels agree in ATR with the first vowel of the word

2\. Glide formation


In a sequence of two vowels V<sub>1</sub>V<sub>2</sub>, V<sub>1</sub>
becomes a glide if it is high.

3\. Diphthong formation


In a sequence of two vowels V<sub>1</sub>V<sub>2</sub>, V<sub>1</sub>
forms a diphthong with V<sub>2</sub> if V<sub>1</sub> has higher
sonority.

4\. V<sub>2</sub> deletion


In a sequence of two vowels V<sub>1</sub>V<sub>2</sub>, V<sub>2</sub> is
deleted.

5\. Strident cluster reduction


Stridents are deleted before stridents

6\. Strident voicing


Stridents are voiced before voiced consonants

7\. Intervocalic voicing of obstruents


Obstruents are voiced intervocalically

8\. Oral+nasal stop cluster reduction


Oral stops before nasal stops are deleted if they have the same place of
articulation

9\. Degemination


Geminate consonants are degeminated

10\. Final devoicing of obstruents


Obstruents word finally are devoiced

## Nouns

A number of postpositional clitics can be attached to a noun phrase (NP)
which marks the head noun's syntactic role, spatial or temporal
relations, and person. These clitics are divided into four types: core
case clitics (marking mandatory arguments of verbs), peripheral case
clitics (consisting mainly of locative cases), the genitive clitics, and
the person clitics. The core and peripheral case clitics are together
known as "case clitics," which never co-occur with the genitive clitics.

</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Gender

Nouns have an inherent gender, either mundane or arcane, which the noun
phrase (NP) clitics agree in. NP clitics attached to coordinated NPs
with both mundane and arcane coordinands are always mundane. The
following examples use the mundane (MND) noun Serszec and the arcane
(ARC) nouns Andeija and Dovreija. In both (1) and (2) Serszec and
Andeija are part of the same NP coordinated by *sta* "and", but (2) is
ungrammatical because it uses the arcane form of the genitive clitic
when the NP has a mundane coordinand. On the other hand, (3) also uses
the arcane genitive clitic, but is grammatical because all coordinands
are arcane.

    (1) "Serszec sta Andeijanos"
        Serszec      sta Andeija=nos
        Serszec(MND) and Andeija(ARC)=GEN.MND
        "of Serszec and Andeija"

    (2) *"Serszec sta Andeijasejr"
        Serszec      sta Andeija=sejr
        Serszec(MND) and Andeija(ARC)=GEN.ARC
        *"of Serszec and Andeija"

    (3) "Dovreija sta Andeijasejr"
        Dovreija      sta Andeija=nos
        Dovreija(ARC) sta Andeija(ARC)=GEN.ARC
        "of Dovreija and Andeija"

Arcane gender nouns are typically words borrowed from Andeijan at
various points in Malaszec's history, and the arcane gender forms of
clitics are also the result of borrowing. Since the social status of
Andeijan during the centuries-long Areman Malaszec Empire and early
Communist Malaszec was quite low, lexical borrowing from Andeijan
declined and as a result, mundane nouns greatly outnumber arcane nouns.
Words formed through compounding take the same gender as their head
word.

The arcane gender is so named because most of the borrowed words
describe magical phenomena or faeries, and in reality many words for
magical phenomena and items are mundane gender. For example, *sela*
"magic" is mundane. There also exists synonym pairs whose main
difference is their gender, although the use of one or the other usually
has a specific connotation. For example, there are two words for
"faerie," *kasja* (mundane) and *ritja* (arcane), with *ritja* deriving
from Andeijan.

### Core case clitics

<table class="wikitable">
<caption>Core case clitics

<th>Arcane
</th></tr>
<tr>
<th>Agentive
</th>
<td>mir
</td>
<td>mav
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Patientive
</th>
<td colspan="2">∅
</td></tr></tbody></table>

The core case clitics express the mandatory subject/object verb
arguments. Malaszec is a fluid-S active-stative language, where the
subject of intransitive verbs are either agentive or patientive
depending on volition. The patientive is unmarked, and implies
ambivalence or unintentionality, which the agentive is marked and
implies intentionality. Contrast *helos* "person" in the following
examples: in (1), helos is unmarked and therefore patientive (PAT) while
in (2), helosmir is marked agentive (AGT).

    (1) "helos tek"
        helos=∅    tek
        person=PAT go
        "The person went (unintentionally or ambivalently)"

    (2) "helosmir tek"
        helos=mir  tek
        person=AGT go
        "The person went (intentionally)"

The core case clitics may co-occur with the peripheral case clitics. The
core case clitic will lose its syntactic meaning, but will affect the
peripheral case in volition. See the peripheral case clitics section for
details.

### Peripheral case clitics

|                              | Mundane | Arcane |
|------------------------------|---------|--------|
| Dative-Benefactive           | lij     | esz    |
| Instrumental-Comitative      | dala    | szak   |
| Ablative-Causative           | vras    | mij    |
| Locative ("in, at")          | ren     |        |
| Illative ("into")            | osz     |        |
| Distantative ("beyond")      | atvij   |        |
| Temporal ("during")          | na      |        |
| Intrative ("between, among") | ivis    |        |

Peripheral case clitics

Peripheral case clitics may follow a core case clitic. When this
happens, the core case clitic no longer expresses its syntactic
relation, and instead expresses whether or not the head noun is willing
to be in the situation expressed by the peripheral clitic. For example,
in (1), *helos* "person" has both the patientive (PAT) core clitic and
the illative (ILL) peripheral clitic which implies the person has
different volition compared to (2), where person has the agentive (AGT)
and illative clitics.

If the noun is inanimate but it has the agentive clitic, indicating
positive volition, then it is generally assumed that the volition refers
to someone whose relation to the noun is most salient since inanimate
objects have no volition. Example of this is in (3): *tals* "house" has
the agentive and illative clitics, but is inanimate, so the volition
belongs to the owner of the house, who would be most affected by their
own house. It is thus assumed that the owner of the house invited the
person to the house.

    (1) "viszkmir helososz let"
        viszk=mir helos=∅=osz   let
        dog=AGT   person=PAT=ILL bite
        "The dog bit into the person (and the person did not want it)"

    (2) "viszkmir helosmirosz let"
        viszk=mir helos=mir=osz  let
        dog=AGT   person=AGT=ILL bite
        "The dog bit into the person (and the person wanted it)"

    (3) "helos talsmirosz tek"
        helos=AGT  tals=mir=osz  tek
        person=AGT house=AGT=ILL go
        "The person went into the house (invited)"

There are three clitics that can express syntactic relations, which
unlike the other peripheral case clitics, have a mundane and an arcane
form. These clitics also have special meanings when attached to a
nominalized verb phrase (VP).

|                         | Argument                | Meaning                               | Notes                                                                                                                               |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Instrumental-Comitative | Noun phrase             | with NP, using NP                     | If NP is a person but in the patientive, it is implied that they are being used or dragged along                                    |
|                         | Nominalized verb phrase | what with VP                          | VP expresses the circumstances or time in which the main verb is happening, but is not necessarily the cause (unlike ABL-CAUS + VP) |
| Dative-Benefactive      | Noun phrase             | to NP, for NP                         |                                                                                                                                     |
|                         | Nominalized verb phrase | in order to VP, for the purpose of VP |                                                                                                                                     |
| Ablative-Causative      | Noun phrase             | from NP, out of NP                    |                                                                                                                                     |
|                         | Nominalized verb phrase | because of VP                         |                                                                                                                                     |

<caption>Genitive clitics

The genitive clitics mark an NP as the possessor of another NP that
follows it.

Nouns are third person by default, but adding a person suffix can make
it first or second person. A person clitic cannot be added if the head
of the noun phrase is a nominalized verb phrase.

Using these clitics with names, which have a fixed referent, is usually
not allowed. One exception is during a self-introduction, when it is
appropriate to use the first person clitic with one's own name. Another
exception is when it is being used to disambiguate between two entities
of the same name. For example, if there are two people named Asalij, one
of whom is a collocutor and another is elsewhere in the room, then using
*Asalijsze* to refer only to the collocutor is permissible.

When an inanimate noun is marked first or second person, the meaning is
metaphorical. For example, *viszk* "dog" plus the second person clitic
*sze* literally means "dog (who you are)," but is generally taken to be
an insult.

## Pronouns

### Personal pronouns

|               | First person | Second person       |
|---------------|--------------|---------------------|
| Formal        | kalzanja     | jokalsze            |
| Polite        | lejnirnja    | melosze             |
| Familiar      | zanejnja     | zanejsze            |
| Very familiar | zanja        | zansze              |
| Derogatory    | N/A          | lejnirsze/galzansze |

Common personal pronoun formations

All Malaszec pronouns in common use are derived from nouns with first or
second person clitics that have been grammaticalised, losing its
original semantic meaning. For example, *jokal* itself means "a person
who is one's senior or superior," while *jokalsze* with the second
person *sze* clitic is simply the formal second person pronoun. These
pronouns come from Malaszec spoken during the Areman Empire, when
society was highly stratified and individuals of different classes or
occupations were expected to address each other accordingly. Most of
these forms address fell out of common usage after the Malaszec
Communist Revolution, leaving only a subset of pronouns which differ
mainly in formality regardless of class or occupation.

## Verbs

### Aspect

| Aspect      | Suffix |
|-------------|--------|
| Perfective  | -∅     |
| Continuous  | -val   |
| Momentane   | -ran   |
| Frequentive | -kep   |
| Gnomic      | -rej   |

Aspect suffixes

Aspect indicates the duration of an action within time. Malaszec has
several types of aspect: perfective, continuous, frequentive, momentane,
and gnomic.

- The **perfective aspect** is unmarked, and indicates a completed
  action. When speaking of the present, an action in the perfective may
  have present relevance.

  *For example,*votnik*can mean "you should have stopped (and possibly
  be continuing to stop)"*
- The **continuous aspect** suffix is *-val*, and indicates an ongoing
  action.
- The **momentane aspect** suffix is *-ran*, and indicates an action
  that happened momentarily or suddenly. It has a connotation of
  involuntariness.
- The **frequentive aspect** suffix is *-kep*, and indicates actions
  which are performed over and over again. It is also used for habitual
  actions.
- The **gnomic aspect** suffix is *-rej*, and indicates general truths
  or facts. It can also be used as an intense form of the frequentive
  aspect, usually to indicate stubbornness and has a negative or curious
  connotation when used this way.

### Tense

| Tense    | Suffix |
|----------|--------|
| Non-past | -∅     |
| Past     | -er    |

Tense suffixes

There are only two tenses: past and non-past. The unmarked tense is
non-past, which by default indicates present time, while past tense is
marked with *-er*. For all tenses, more specific time is determined by
time words and phrases that appear in the sentence, like "yesterday",
"tomorrow", or "at noon".

### Mood

| Mood        | Suffix |
|-------------|--------|
| Indicative  | -∅     |
| Subjunctive | -rijr  |
| Optative    | -nik   |

Mood suffixes

Mood indicates the reality of an action. Malaszec has three moods:
indicative (unmarked), subjunctive (*-rijr*), and optative (*-nik*). The
indicative mood indicates actions which are believed to be real or have
happened and the subjunctive mood indicates actions which are imagined,
possible, or uncertain. The optative mood indicates actions which are
hoped for or desired, and is also used for commands.

### Negation

Verb phrase negation is expressed using the adverb *ajl*. If the verb
phrase is a part of a subordinate clause marked by a complementiser,
then the negative complementiser *sjal* is used instead.

### Nominalisation

Verb phrases can be nominalised with the *jan* suffix on the main verb.

## Coordination

Nouns, noun phrases, verb phrases, and sentences are coordinated using a
monosyndetic conjunction before the final coordinand. Conjunctive
coordination of adjectives, adverbs, adjective phrases, and adverb
phrases are always done through juxtaposition, but other types of
coordination are monosyndetic. The conjunctive conjunction for all
syntactic categories is *sta* "and."

## Question forming

Questions are asked with a rising intonation at the end.

### Yes-no questions

Yes-no questions are formed using the verb *hlos* "to wonder, to
question" followed by a subjunctive VP and the complementiser *dlaj*.

### Wh-questions

Wh-questions are formed using a subjunctive VP and interrogative
pronouns.
