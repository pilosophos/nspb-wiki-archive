The **Alliance For Democratic Szamara** or **ADS** is an international
organization and military alliance. Formed initially to provide mutual
defence against the [Socialist Friendship
Convention](Socialist_Friendship_Convention "wikilink"), it has expended
its purpose to promote democracy, free trade and international
cooperation against organized crime and terrorism.

## History

### Background

The collapse of the [Malaszec](Malaszec "wikilink") and
[Urendin](Erothena "wikilink") Empires saw a rapid transformation of the
world order. The industrial revolution gave birth not only to an
unprecedented era of economical growth but also of communist ideology
which saw a meteoric rise with the Malaszec revolution in 1932. The fear
of a communist empire under Malaszec lead to proposals of a
counter-alliance among Urendin politicians already in the 1930s but the
chaos of the revolution and the [Dwerchus
War](First_Dwerchus_War "wikilink") put developments on hold.

### Formation and Early Years

### Post Cold War

## Goals and Purpose

The foremost goal of the ADS has from the very start been to protect
representative democracy, free enterprise, private property and sapient
rights among member statates.
