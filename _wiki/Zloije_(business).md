*This article is about zloije in their business/corporate capacity. For
the related geopolitical entities, see [Wards and cities of
Malaszec](Wards_and_cities_of_Malaszec "wikilink").*

Zloije (abbreviated "ZE") are nine large conglomerate corporations that
rose to power in Malaszec after the dissolution of the [Malaszec
People's
Republic](Malaszec#Industrial_revolution_and_Communist_Malaszec "wikilink")
(MPR). The name comes from the nine administrative divisions of the
former MPR, which were called zloije. These zloije were bought up by the
wealthy elite and the industry and land were reorganized into the
modern, corporate zloije. Due to the diverse portfolio of industries
each zloije competes in, zloje are organized into tenzloije, or
subsidiaries of zloije, which themselves can have more tenzloije under
them. Zloije operate under their own laws, and their only supreme law
comes from the [Chamber of Commerce](Malaszec#Government "wikilink"),
which is comprised of delegates from the zloije themselves. Each zloije
has overseas operations, and are known to start joint ventures to be
more competitive with foreign businesses.

## Agerszijn

![](Agerszijn.png "Agerszijn.png") Agerszijn is historically known for
its mining industry, as the land is rich in minerals and precious
metals. It lost its ground to Dovreija as early as the Malaszec
communist era during the Dovreijan Boom, although Agerszijn's mining
operations remain an important part of Agerszijn today. Agerszijn is now
mostly known for its high-tech development, thanks to
Agerszijnijekeposzvec, which was created as a science park and was
completed the year before the privatization of Agerszijn zloije.

## Andeija

Andeija is the ancestral homeland of the Malaszec faeries and is known
for its production of magical plants and magical products. Some of its
subsidiaries trace their origins back centuries, especially those
specializing in agribusiness or apotheceuticals. Andeija's brand
revolves around their rich history, although in the case of newer
ventures, the origin stories are often completely made up.

| Talzoseija |      | Heavy equipment | Andeija ZE    | None         |

## Dovreija

Dovreija became industrially relevant in Malaszec following the
Dovreijan Boom during the Malaszec communist era. New surveying methods
led to the discovery of a mineral wealth large enough to dethrone
Agerszijn in the mining industry. Dovreija remains an active mining
region with a notable manufacturing base. Within manufacturing, it is
known for making products catered towards faeries owing to its faerie
population and proximity to the other faerie zloije.

## Esterlod

Esterlod particularly excels in the field of biotechnology, including
biomedical, biochemistry, and food sciences. It is known for it
soy-based synthetic meat after buying the now-president [Ilaje
Otrovec's](Ilaje_Otrovec "wikilink") synthetic meat company in 2041, and
synthmeat sales have since overtaken sales of real meat due to its low
cost. It came under fire for the [Arev
Incident](Arev_Incident "wikilink") in 2047, where the company caused
the town of Arev and the surrounding countryside to become infested with
a genetically modified fungus intended as a magical energy source.
Another large scandal happened in 2054 when early production runs of
StreamEye, a wireless cybernetic eye produced by the company, was
vulnerable to a maliciously crafted QR code that would cause the eye to
shut down.

## Rescija

![](Rescija-logo.png "Rescija-logo.png") For centuries, Rescija's
economy was dominated by cattle ranching and animal products. In the
communist era, cultivation methods for the Rescijan firesurfer spawned a
thriving pharmaceutical industry, since it is used to produce medicine
critical for faeries in low mana environments. During the formation of
the Malaszec Federation, Rescija ZE acquired these industries. However,
the popularization of low-cost soy-based synthetic meat in the 2040s and
50s led to a decline in the sale of real meat. With this decline,
Rescija was losing a large chunk of their customer base― the middle
class― and revenues were dropping. In 2055, Rescija's meat division
started marketing its products as luxuries catering to the upper class.
To lean into this luxury image, the Rescija brand was redesigned and
licensed to other companies to use on high-end products.

Currently, the majority of consumer products bearing the Rescija brand
are actually manufactured by other companies. Rescija's only
manufactured exports are meat and pharmaceuticals, while the rest of its
business consists of licensing, marketing, and tourism.

## Serszec

Serszec has the country's largest manufacturing base, processing ores
and minerals from the south into value added goods. Industrial cities
are highly automated, with drones and robots omnipresent in the
factories and in the skies.
