## Guidelines and Info

The current year in the canon is {{#expr: (2069 +  - 2019) }}, with the
earliest industrial revolution starting in 1919. The canon calendar year
begins when it's winter in the **southern hemisphere**.

1.  Our main races are human and human-adjacent, who have capabilities
    and intelligence more or less similar to a human
2.  All magic and technology must not exceed capabilities currently
    replicable currently (IRL) in a laboratory setting. Current (IRL)
    emergent technology is the norm in our setting.
3.  Mana is a non-renewable resource that can be mined. Things and
    creatures imbued with mana, or which consume mana, exhibit magical
    properties. Mana follows the laws of conservation.
4.  Mana-rich areas suitable for industrial mining are surrounded by
    dangerous magical creatures and phenomena. Mana which seeps into
    water and soil is less dangerous but weaker, and was the most common
    way to use magic before the industrial era.

### Terms for OOC communication

When discussing the NSPBverse out of character, these terms are defined
for the purpose of clear communication:

  **Sentience** refers to the animal-like ability to experience
  sensations.
- **Soul** refers to a hypothetical and immaterial vessel for
  consciousness that is separable from the physical form of body.
  **Consciousness** refers to the collective biases, experiences, and/or
  characteristics that define an individual or identity.
