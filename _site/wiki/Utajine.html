<p>The <strong>Utajine</strong> Corporation is one of four megacorporations originating
from <a href="Erothena" title="wikilink">Erothena</a>. The holding company, fully owned
by the Utajine family, has governing shares in a vast number of
subsidiary corporations that together form the Utajine conglomerate.
Utajine is the leading defense contractor for Erothena and Utajine’s
Private Military forces make up a majority of troops in occupied

<p>Since the late 15th century the noble Utajine family held domain in the
ore-rich lands of central Erothena, earning much of their wealth from
the iron mines. Over the centuries they’d open both mines, foundries and
steel mills to better take advantage of the natural wealth and
throughout most of Urendir’s colonial expansion Utajine owned armouries
supplies the majority of weapons for the royal armies. In 1898 the
Utajine Corporation, alongside the Utajine bank was formed to better
centralize and oversee control over the vast network of business all
originating from what was now an effective monopoly of iron mining in
Urendir and its empire.</p>

<p>The first company president Utajine Ujamore was quick to adopt the new
steam engines coming out to mechanize their mines, vastly expanding the
output of both steel and coal which in turn allowed for the creation of
the fully industrialized Royal Utajine Shipyard in Hevarukaman in 1922.
Utajine designed and constructed a series of steam-powered ironclad
warships that would quickly be adopted by the Royal Navy and turn it
into one of the most powerful forces in Jamara. The new fleet would
prove its worth, defeating their Malaszec counterparts in the
<a href="Bangsalayan_War" title="wikilink">Bangsalayan War</a>.</p>

<p>The close bonds between Utajine and the Royal navy troubled the king who
begun formulating plans to break up Utajine’s monoply, all of which were
ended by the 1936 revolution. Utajine Ujamore himself was killed during
the <a href="May_Restoration" title="wikilink">May Restoration</a>, leaving power to his
daughter Utajine Xatheya, who has headed the company since. With the
beginning of the republic and its ending of royal anti-trust laws
Utajine began a mass expansion into civilian industry as well as
purchasing Erothena’s fledgling railway companies. They also began an
expansion into <a href="Dwerchus" title="wikilink">Dwerchus</a>, opening mines and steel
mills. The instability in the region with the armed conflict between
government forces and the <a href="Dwerchan_Independence_Front" title="wikilink">Dwerchan Independence
Front</a> necessitated the
formation of a private military force in 1962, Potakor Security, which
was quickly adopted by <a href="Korerida" title="wikilink">Korerida</a> as well as
several municipalities to aid in their protection against Dwerchan
militancy.</p>

<p>Following the <a href="Second_Dwerchus_War" title="wikilink">Second Dwerchus War</a>,
Utajine purchased approximately a quarter of all of Dwerchus, gaining
control of the great ore-rich regions and a port on the purple sea in
the form of Ordam. Utajine, through their subsidiary Potakor is
responsible for monitoring and managing mana-enhanced organisms
originating from lake Kemaxa and their weapons divisions have used the
near-infinite monstrous forces as test objects for each new generation
of weaponry.</p>
