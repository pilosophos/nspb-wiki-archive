<p>The <strong>Tormansco-Galleno Equations</strong> are a series of equation that are
utilized by <a href="Clairvoyance" title="wikilink">clairvoyants</a> in order to predict
long-term phenomena in society. The Equations were discovered by
<a href="Tormansco_the_Oracle" title="wikilink">Tormansco the Oracle</a> and Datamage
<a href="Galleno" title="wikilink">Galleno</a> in the late 20th century</p>

<p>The <strong>Tormansco Equation</strong> also known as the <strong>Tormansco Score</strong> is an
equation formulated by Tormansco following inaccuracies in the
predictions of the Tormansco-Galleno Equation. Once filled in, the
equation gives a value that is used to correct the Tormansco-Galleno
Equation. Due to how the Equation works, the number is sometimes called
the “Tormansco Universe Number” or TUN and can be used to determine
universal deviation from a hypothetical non-clairvoyant standard.</p>
