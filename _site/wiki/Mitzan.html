<p><strong>Mitzan</strong> is a bat-and-ball team sport with nine flying
broomstick-mounted players on each of the two teams, typically played on
an outdoor Mitzan field 100 meters long and 50 meters wide with two
movable goals. for each team The aim of the game is to score the most
points by hitting the ball through the goal, with more points awarded
depending on the hitting player’s distance from the goal. The game
originated in <a href="Malaszec" title="wikilink">Malaszec</a> in the late 18th century,
evolving from various aerial bat-and-ball games which preceded it. Since
its genesis, Mitzan has grown to an international audience and is
currently governed by the International Mitzan Federation, which has
organized the Mitzan World Cup every four years since 1880.</p>

<h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>

<p>Playing Mitzan requires the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A rectangular field, typically covered in grass and 100 meters by 50
meters in size, with two scoring arclines (the “inner” and “outer”
arcs) on each side and a centerline dividing the field in half.</li>
  <li>A movable, flying circular goals on each of the short sides of the
field for each team, for a total of two.</li>
  <li>One glowing, spherical, 21 cm flying ball which ignores gravity and
obeys air resistance.</li>
  <li>Nine flying Mitzan brooms for each team, which may resemble typical
household brooms, for a total of eighteen.</li>
  <li>Seven bats for each of the hitters on each team, for a total of
fourteen.</li>
  <li>Two spellcasting devices for each of the mages on each team, for a
total of four.</li>
</ul>

<p>The game starts when all players are in position on their side of the
field and the referee launches the ball upwards from the ground on
middle of the centerline. The goal of the game is to score as many
points into the opposing player’s goal by the end of the typically 60
minute-long game.</p>

<p>The seven <strong>hitters</strong> on a team are equipped with bats and are allowed
to score by hitting the ball with the bat into the opposing team’s goal.
The two <strong>mages</strong> on a team are equipped with spellcasting devices and
may not score directly. The <strong>goalie</strong> position may be any player,
whether hitter or mage, and may be changed during gameplay. All players
are allowed to move any goal.</p>

<p>A hitter who hits the ball into the opposing team’s goal from within the
inner arc scores for their own team 1 point, from between the inner and
outer arc 2 points, and outside the outer arc 3 points. Mages are not
allowed to score the ball directly, but may create conditions beneficial
for their team’s hitter to score. Mages may cast spells on the ball
(e.g. to affect its motion), or on the environment. Mages may only cast
one-off spells that do not require concentration, and in professional
Mitzan leagues, Mitzan trackers are installed on the mage’s spellcasting
device to aid with refereeing and televising.</p>

<p>If a team causes the ball to go out of the bounds of the field, the ball
changes possession to the other team, who resumes play by having the
hitter hit the ball from where the ball went out of bounds. If the
referee rules that a team’s player has fouled, then the opposing team is
given possession of the ball from the centerline.</p>

<p>The International Mitzan Federation (IMF) was founded in 1880 to host
and regulate the Mitzan World Cup, currently the largest professional
Mitzan league. Due to Malaszec colonialism, Mitzan spread across the
world necessitating its the foundation of the IMF. It is one of the few
institutions from Malaszec’s imperial era to survive both the Malaszec
Communist revolution and the formation of the Malaszec Federation.</p>
