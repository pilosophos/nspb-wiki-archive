<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<h3 id="background">Background</h3>

<p>The collapse of the <a href="Malaszec" title="wikilink">Malaszec</a> and
<a href="Erothena" title="wikilink">Urendin</a> Empires saw a rapid transformation of the
world order. The industrial revolution gave birth not only to an
unprecedented era of economical growth but also of communist ideology
which saw a meteoric rise with the Malaszec revolution in 1932. The fear
of a communist empire under Malaszec lead to proposals of a
counter-alliance among Urendin politicians already in the 1930s but the
chaos of the revolution and the <a href="First_Dwerchus_War" title="wikilink">Dwerchus
War</a> put developments on hold.</p>
