<p>Almost 71% of <a href="Malaszec" title="wikilink">Malaszec’s</a> land is agricultural
land used for grazing, irrigation farming, and dryland farming. Nearly
all farming in Malaszec is automated and managed by decreasing numbers
of professional farmers in rural areas. Rural farmers generally raise
corn and soy, which displaced wheat as the most produced Malaszec crop
during the transition from communist to federal Malaszec. Production of
magical plants is mostly concentrated around Andeija, which has ideal
conditions for magical farming due to its tidal rivers which brings mana
from the ground into the surrounding flood plains. Many cities have had
their communist-era green belts converted into vertical farms producing
cash crops. Nearly all magical farms are owned and run by subsidiary
companies of the <a href="Wards_and_cities_of_Malaszec" title="wikilink">wards</a>, but
most are legally independent farms with farmers receiving a license to
farm on corporate-owned land.</p>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>The first agrarian societies in Malaszec were started by faeries in the
tidal rivers of what is known as Andeija. In addition to grain crops,
they cultivated various magical plants because of the ideal conditions
the tidal river provided. As human and elven civilizations arose in the
north, much of the Malaszec subcontinent’s arable land became farms for
wheat, barley, and flax. While there was some cultivation of magical
plants in the north, most notably in elven country, the south greatly
outclassed the north in production. Advancements in irrigation allowed
the northern empires to greatly expand their farming output.</p>

<p>Agriculture in the Dovreijan desert was historically limited, and the
population was sparse. Inhabitants seldom had access to the irrigation
technology that would have made the area more effective farmland.
Slash-and-burn agricultural was predominant for much of Dovrija’s known
inhabited history, and it was not until after the forced relocation of
faeries to the area during Imperial Malaszec and the creation of major
irrigation works during the Dovreijan Boom that the area became both
more populated and a voluminous agricultural producer.</p>

<h2 id="major-agricultural-products">Major agricultural products</h2>

<p>The crops with the biggest production in Malaszec are corn and soy,
which have a variety of applications beyond foodstuffs. These crops
overtook former staples such as wheat and barley during the transition
from communist to federal Malaszec, as the quotas which were in place
started to break down and farmers started prioritizing crops that the
newly forming corporations would pay for. Corn and soy are used to
create cattle feed, biofuel, bioplastics, artificial sweeteners,
synthetic meat, among other things. This flexibility, combined with the
availability of genetically modified and magically enhanced crop seed
massively favors these two crops. Though diminishing in importance,
crops such as cotton and citrus remain staples of agriculture in the
southeast. Irrigation during the Dovreijan Boom led to an explosion in
agricultural products in the desert.</p>

<p>Although synthetic meats made from soy protein are dominant in the
Malaszec meat market, cattle and sheep remain important to national
agriculture, particularly in Rescija and Astlod. Real meat is either
consumed by the upper-mid and upper class, who can afford it, or is
exported internationally. Same goes for other animal products such as
milk, eggs, wool, and leather. While synthetic substitutes have a
greater market share, their niche as luxury products creates a bigger
profit margin.</p>

<p>In areas receptive to magical farming, Andeija and eastern Rescija in
particular, large-scale magical agriculture produces Dorovian
crossbloom, firesurfer, among others. These magical crops are important
for the apotheceutical industry, which uses them to make drugs. The
firesurfer, for example, is used to make mana supplement for treating
<a href="Faerie#Mana_deficiency" title="wikilink">mana deficiency</a>.</p>

<h2 id="vertical-farming-products">Vertical farming products</h2>

<p>The green belts that were established in cities across Malaszec during
the communist era are typically replaced by vertical farms. These are
run by the municipal corporations governing each individual cities,
contrasting with conventional farms run by or under license of
agribusiness subsidiaries. These vertical farms are more geared towards
tourists and grow exotic plants within climate controlled confines.
During the Imperial Malaszec colony of T’annkirne, misted manaberries,
used to make Tenvekrost (a Malaszec liquor made from misted manaberries)
became popular. Though its role in apotheceuticals was replaced by
domestically produced firesurfer, the berries remained in demand. The
manaberries cultivated in Malaszec’s vertical farms, though more
expensive than those grown in T’annkirne due to low yields, are
preferred by some for their reportedly unique flavor profile and
experience.</p>
