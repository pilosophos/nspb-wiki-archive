<p><strong>The First Dwerchus War</strong>, also known as the <strong>Dwerchan War of
Independence</strong>, was a war fought by the unrecognized Republic of
Dwerchus and the Republic of <a href="Erothena" title="wikilink">Erothena</a> between
1947 and 1949.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>Following the Erothenan revolution of 1938, the status of the Dwerchan
protectorate became a suddenly complicated issues. For centuries the
region had existed as a semi-autonomous state loyal directly to the
Urendin crown, and the question became if Dwerchus was bound only to the
king in person or the realm headed by them.</p>

<p>Three councils were held in Thinetavu in 1939, 1940 and 1943 to discuss
the future of royal subjects, leading to the confirmation of
independence for both Bangsalaya and Tilive but without achieving any
final clarification on the Dwerchan question. As a concession to
Dwerchus the 1943 council ended with the dissolution of the Royal
Dwerchan Trading Company and their trade monopoly within the region and
in general the status quo remained.</p>

<p>However after four more years of fruitless negotiations the radical
nationalist faction within the Erothenian senate began to push for an
end to the special subject status of Dwerchus and to instead fully annex
it into the republic, with full citizenship for all inhabitants. This
possibility alarmed the Dwerchan elite who were afraid to lose not only
their autonomy but their special status under Urendin law - the
Constitution of Erothena had already depowered orcish nobility by
granting orcs full citizenship. To prevent this the first speaker Gorim
Gyrnhelm used growing nationalist sentiments to officially declare an
independent Republic of Dwerchus on the 4th of September 1947.</p>
