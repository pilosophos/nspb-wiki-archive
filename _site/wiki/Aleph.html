<p><strong>Aleph</strong> are the de facto rulers of <a href="Name_Pending" title="wikilink">[Name
Pending</a>]. Their creation marks year zero of
the <a href="Manic_Calendar" title="wikilink">Manic Calendar</a>, nearly 87 years ago.
Although Aleph is effectively one person, they were created by 14 mages
during the <a href="Luddite_Wars" title="wikilink">Luddite Wars</a> and directly control
almost all aspects of life in [Name Pending]. Since 0AA, there have
been over 55 more people added to Aleph. Many of these added people are
kept on Alephs Beta through Omicron, which oversee the various judicial
and executive functions of [Name Pending].</p>

<h3 id="history">History</h3>

<p>During the height of the Luddite War, socialists flooded into the Palm
from the west forcing the <a href="Quorum_of_the_Mages" title="wikilink">fourteen leaders of the
kingdom</a> to create a machine that could
both use their mana and make decisions using their intellect. From 2 BA
to 13 AA, the Quorum led the combined Palmist-Socialist forces against
the Luddites winning the war, and establishing the legitimacy of Alephâ€™s
authority.</p>
