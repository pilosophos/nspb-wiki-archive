<p>Elves are often recognized by their pointed ears. By maintaining a
steady diet of mana, elves retain a youthful appearance and can live up
to five times longer than a human. However, the amount of mana required
to be ingested increases as they age, and most elves cannot afford to
extend their life this long.</p>

<h3 id="malaszec">Malaszec</h3>

<p>The first known elvish civilization in <a href="Malaszec" title="wikilink">Malaszec</a>
existed in inland along the Sarlej River, where the modern day city of
Sarlej stands. Many early Malaszec elvish civilizations were
isolationists, and rejected other species. At times, Malaszec elves
broke this isolationist streak, and great empires were founded by elves
in the Malaszec peninsula. The last of which was the final Malaszec
Empire, which united the Malaszec peninsula for the first time. During
this time, integrated cities of elves and humans became the norm in
Malaszec, which continues to this day. In Malaszec, elves can be found
in greatest numbers in the west (often dubbed “Elvish Country”) or
living in metropolitan areas across the country, with the exception of
faerie cities not designed for cohabitation.</p>
