<p>The <em>â€˜International Regulations and Standards Body</em> (IRSB,
<em>Olosijejvizdadromkanlajzjanfos</em> in
<a href="Malaszec_language" title="wikilink">Malaszec</a>) is an international advisory
board that publishes and licenses industrial standards for commercial
and government use. It was founded in <a href="Dorovec" title="wikilink">Dorovec,
Malaszec</a> in 2027 after the formation of the
<a href="Malaszec" title="wikilink">Malaszec Federation</a> to standardize commercial
protocols between the Erothenian Bloc and the former Socialist
Friendship Convention. The organization and its subcommittees are
notable for maintaining the Metric Unit System, the standard time zones,
and the <a href="International_Social_Credit_System" title="wikilink">ISCS</a> protocol.</p>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>The collapse of Communist Malaszec and the formation of the Malaszec
Federation signaled the end of the cold war, with the Socialist
Friendship Convention dismantled and nations of the two major blocs
engaging in more open trade. The sudden increase in trade among nations
who formerly restricted trade with each other meant that commercial
standards needed to be adopted for efficient commerce. Thus the IRSB was
founded in Dorovec shortly after the formation of the Federation in 2027
as a subcommittee of the Malaszec legislature, the Chamber of Commerce.
Over time, it grew in the number of members advising in all its
industrial standards, with a vastly different governing structure and
operating procedure.</p>
