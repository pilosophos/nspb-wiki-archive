<p><strong>Geyser Island</strong> is an island in the sea between
<a href="Erothena" title="wikilink">Erothena</a> and <a href="Malaszec" title="wikilink">Malaszec</a>
notable for its volatile mana geyser. The mana geyser regularly ejects
magically charged geyser water, creating dangerous phenomena such as
water elementals. Though the island has a high concentration of mana, it
is unsuitable for industrial exploitation due to the water elementals
which jealously guard the geyser from outsiders.</p>

<h2 id="water-elementals">Water Elementals</h2>

<p>Water elementals are created by the islandâ€™s mana geyser by imbuing
magical energy into ejected water. These water elementals are hostile to
other life forms and will destroy those who come too near the geyser.
Some water elementals may lose their way and end up at sea, where they
will become confused and behave erratically. Drawing in the surrounding
water, they may stir up powerful storms that last for hours.</p>

<h2 id="legend">Legend</h2>

<p>It is said that in prehistory, two arcane dinosaur-like beings lived
there. They fed upon the trees and vegetation, and they lived in harmony
for thousands of years.</p>

<p>One day, the island quaked, and through it a rift formed. Each one of
these creatures came to the rift, and thereupon spewed forth arcane
energy. They stood by in wonderment, transfixed by the wondrous sights
it created. The longer they stood, the more addled their minds became,
until they were nothing but savage beasts.</p>

<p>They fought and they fought, and through their fighting, the ground
beneath them began to crack. The tides rushed in, and they were carried
away by the tempests into the seas. One washed ashore to Erothena and
traveled north to the lush rain forests where he lived to old age. One
washed ashore to the south, and travelled south to dry Malaszec. This
one wandered until he got to the desert, where the dryness and
inhospitality of the environment led to its death. Supposedly, these
beasts carried with them the mana they absorbed from the great rift, and
when they died, the ground beneath them became imbued with their mana
for miles around.</p>

<p>The claims made by the legend have not been scientifically verified.</p>
