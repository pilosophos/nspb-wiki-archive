computer-generated at the start of the project.</p>

<p>All three channels (RGB) are the same. The lowest point above sea level
is 90 and the highest is 100.</p>

<p>Each interval of 5 RGB = 700 metres elevation. On the RGB heightmap:</p>

<ul>
  <li>90 RGB corresponds to 0-700 metres above sea level</li>
  <li>95 RGB : 700-1400 m</li>
  <li>100 RGB : 1400-2100 m</li>
</ul>

<p>These values were determined by Lerh on 1 January 2020 in
#great_nspb_canon for creating the climate zones.</p>
