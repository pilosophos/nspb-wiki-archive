and intelligence more or less similar to a human</li>
  <li>All magic and technology must not exceed capabilities currently
replicable currently (IRL) in a laboratory setting. Current (IRL)
emergent technology is the norm in our setting.</li>
  <li>Mana is a non-renewable resource that can be mined. Things and
creatures imbued with mana, or which consume mana, exhibit magical
properties. Mana follows the laws of conservation.</li>
  <li>Mana-rich areas suitable for industrial mining are surrounded by
dangerous magical creatures and phenomena. Mana which seeps into
water and soil is less dangerous but weaker, and was the most common
way to use magic before the industrial era.</li>
