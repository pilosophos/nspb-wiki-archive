<p>Orcs are easily recognized by their tall stature, standing at an average
of 195cm with females being typically taller than the males, as well as
their distinctive enlarged lower canines referred to as tusks. Orcs age
rapidly and have on average around 80% of a humanâ€™s lifespan. Due to a
genetic weakness to mana Orc have more difficulty learning to master
personal magic and may have a higher risk of contracting long-term
adverse health effects from exposure to mana or magic.</p>

western <a href="Erothena" title="wikilink">Erothena</a> has some of the oldest remains
of orcish settlement and habitation in Szamara. The region was home to a
number of sovereign tribes and kingdom until it was annexed into the
republic of Erothena in 1941. Since then orcs have spread across the
nation and generally integrated into Erothenian society, forming a
significant minority of the population.</p>
