<p><strong>Club Ball</strong> or <strong>Ueus Seholios</strong> (<em>“Course of the Sun”</em>, <em>“Daily
Agenda”</em>) is a game within the Thrown ball family, related to
<a href="Sphaerium" title="wikilink">Sphaerium</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_(game)">Tag</a>. While the Club Ball
League has existed in some way, shape, or form since 1204 (with the
formation of the <a href="Blessed_Rounders'_Guild" title="wikilink">Blessed Rounders’
Guild</a>). The <a href="Palmist_League_of_Club_Ball_Guilds" title="wikilink">modern
league</a> has only existed
since 1910, with its modern league specifications being defined in 1897.</p>

<h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>

<p>Club Ball is composed of 2 teams of 9 people. The two teams are the
“Rounder” team and the “Striker” team.</p>

<p>Each game is composed of <em>“Dags”</em> (Days), <em>“Uges”</em> (Weeks), and
<em>“Chuckles”</em> (from <em>“Odineros”</em>, derived from
<a href="Malaszec_language" title="wikilink">mz.</a> <em>“Odinran”</em>) a Week is composed of 9
Days, and a Chuckle is 4 Weeks long. League play is usually 4 Chuckles
long, though casual play is usually just 1 Chuckle.</p>

<p>The Striker Team has two terrestrial positions- the Striker and the
Pitcher- and seven nautical positions in the Sea.</p>

<p>The Rounder Team is composed solely by Rounders.</p>

<p>Each play of a Dag begins with the Pitcher tossing a ball- prior to the
Millennial League Reforms “the Coin”, but the “Ball” since- underhanded
from the Bheus. As soon as the Ball crosses the Borderland, as many
Rounders cross the Borderland across the World as they wish.</p>

<p>If the ball is held or touches a Rounder not on a Holder, the Rounder
must return behind the Borderland and the Striker team wins a point.</p>

<p>Every rounder who runs the perimeter of the Holders and then back behind
the Borderland wins the Rounder team one point.</p>

<p>A Dag ends when all Rounders are on a Holder and the Ball is in the hand
of the Pitcher on the Carrier again.</p>

<p>If the ball enters the Afterlife, all on-Holder Rounders advance one
Holder sequentially or over the Borderland. If the ball can’t be
reasonably retrieved by Nautical positions, they advance 3 Holders.</p>

<p>Once the Dag has ended, Rounders cannot leave their Holder until the
next Dag begins. Every Uge, the teams switch roles.</p>

<p>The winner has the most points by the end of the game.</p>
