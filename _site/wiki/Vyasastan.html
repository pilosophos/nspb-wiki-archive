<p><strong>Vyasastan</strong>, officially known as <strong>The Commonwealth of Vyasastan</strong>, is
a continental boreal country located at the southern tip of Samarah
covering 392,392 square kilometres. It borders the republic of
<a href="Luger" title="wikilink">Luger</a> to the west, the republic of
<a href="Recaria" title="wikilink">Recaria</a> to the east, and the federation of
<a href="Bangsalaya" title="wikilink">Bangsalaya</a> to the north, with its’ southern
boundary held along the Silver Sea and the Southern Ocean. The nation
has a notably large amount of traversable lakes, with Lake Black and
Lake Pendrakhn separating the more temperate steppe parishes of the
north from primarily subarctic territories in the south. Geographically,
Vyasastan is largely forested, predominantly with coniferous larch and
pine trees, broken up by strings of plains in the north and swamps and
peat bogs in the south, rich in preserved natural mana deposits.</p>

<p>Vyasi culture and civilisation dates back to the migration of settler
Sea Peoples from the Southern Oceans, motivated by the fish stocks in
the Silver Sea and the natural and thaumaturgical resources of the
continental region, mixing with notable populations of nomadic natives
already inhabiting Vyasastan. Vyasi settlement was largely split between
multiple duchies, princedoms and merchant kingdoms focused on the
lucrative Southern Ocean Trade, centred around wood, fish, luxurious
furs and bottled mana, with individual cities or guilds forming their
own statelets across the largely unpopulated territory. By the late 17th
century, the major states had been unified under the Plutocrate of
Glashtyn. Syndicalist development in the national psyche followed
unification, with the 1795 Enlightenment cemented by the adoption and
later amendment of the 1810 Social Charter.</p>

<p>The adoption of Industrialism around 1910 propelled, through demographic
boom and an established respect for scientific innovation, Vyasastan
into temporary global relevancy as a minor Industrial power in the
south. The combined capability in industrial and thaumaturgical prowess
during this period, both in agriculture and production led this time to
be known as the <em>Vyasi Gilded Age</em>. Political tensions and a growing
permissive stagnancy through corruption left Vyasastan straggling
globally and soon returning to a “siege mentality” for international
politcs throughout the 20th century. However, national mobilisation
policies enacted during the early 2000s have led to Vyasastan developing
a resurgence in industry, with the redevelopment and reconstruction of
past industrial districts of the Gilded Age. The rapid economic growth
was coined the <em>Miracle on the Sliver Sea</em>, though not without
controversy - with the government coming under criticism due to it’s
subversion of political rights and environmental industrialisation
practices that directly go against the Vyasi Social Charter.</p>

<p>Vyasastan is currently governed by a one-party Socialist Syndicate by
the Vyasi Congress. Based on the uninterrupted despotic rule of Vyasi
Sydnics, the elective lifelong head of state of the government, Vyasi
Syndicalism is a branch of Authoritarian Socialism in service to the
Syndic themselves under the counsel of the electing Syndicate Congress
and influence of the Social Charter constitution.

<h3 id="980-1030">980-1030</h3>

<p>Sourced from Rosamund Bartlett’s ‘Vyasi History 980-1120’, in Dominic
Lieven (ed.), <em>A Brief History of the Kammanvelt Volume I:
Nationbuilding, 980-1550</em> (Glashtyn, 2055), p. 94:</p>

<p>Like the tales of many a culture, Vyasi history begins not in recorded
texts but in the chronicles of oral mythology, passed down for
generations prior to the laying of the first brick of the first Library
on the shores of shivering silver sea. It is in this very period - often
referred to by the Vyasi as the First Age of Heroes - that we must look
to for our first glimpse of the very idea of Vyasastan. As such, this
first segment will rely far more on the ancient tales and legends than
any sourced historical document; for while erstwhile evidence is touted
from many a national historian of the Collages or Patriotic Guilds of
Glashtyn, No learned men of credibility on the international stage have
found their reliability concrete. And so, we begin our tale not with
documentation, but with a story.</p>

<p>In the time before time, and the age before ages, the Silver Sea shook
with envy for the land, who’s beauty of snow-clod mountains and
bountiful forests outshone the dark and fog-struck depths of the sunless
sea. In retaliation for this perceived slight, the sins of envy burst
out from under the cover of the black main, and the sea through its
bitterness in physical form towards its’ unaware rival, and thus cursed
the land with creatures of no holiness, of no beauty - of none but the
highest form of malice. Kelpies, twisted forms of horse and rider
brought together for the common goal of murder of man, bundles of fog
named Minkhs that blanket the coasts to push travelers into the deep -
and eat them there, and many more. But none were as feared as the
Wyverns, beasts that migrated out the silver sea in winged stride,
abandoning their sea-worm identities in the freezing skies above the
land. These creatures were built not only on malice, but on greed and
many a more sin, and would take to this dry frontier as tyrants. There
was not many who settled the carnivorous shores of the Silver - and many
less who truly lived on its’ coasts. Those few, who’s misery was already
paramount, found themselves a mutiny among their dread, when these
tyrants took to their torment with an even greater dedication. The
Wyverns took these natives as food, as slaves, as eternal servants; as
priests, and some even as unwilling wives. They made themselves chiefs
and kings unto their broken populace, with their reverence enshrined in
Theology. The Cult of the Wyvern ensured their grim dedication, with
each Sea-Beast seen as it’s own walking piece of godhood; with the top
of this pantheon claimed by none other but the Lindwyrm, The Drowned
God. A Wyvern born of a malice even more ancient, it’s size hidden not
even by the tallest mountains, and holding the largest fragment of the
Ethereal Plains.</p>

<p>And like this history continued, with the eternal misery cast upon the
lands rotting away any beauty in what once was many a resplendent land.
And for a while, That which was the Silver Sea looked on in smug
satisfaction. This beauty that so carved into it’s heart this
irreparable jealousy fell apart piece by piece, as a rowing boat is torn
apart on jagged rocks. Yet the nagging of envy did not let up to
equality, but to the gnawing realization of its’ own terror. In it’s bid
to bring apart it’s own beauty it did not make itself match the
sweetness of the forest berries - it did not develop beautiful schools
of fish, so colored in their scales like the rainbows of the sky. It did
not provide a serenity in a calming coast that could match that of the
eternal tundra of the land. It did not build beauty. It had only sown
destruction. Was that not it’s original goal? The land was ripped apart,
and now in contrast the seas looked the most inviting, even if in truth
it could not even begin to match. Yet the victory was still hollow. For
the sea was not now beautiful - it was made ugly with sin. in a bout of
self-reflection truly rare to the Ancients, the Silver Sea found itself
enshrouded in grim realization at what it had caused. Instead of
beautiful gifts it had sent that beauty to the crypts, with no chance at
retribution. No chance, at least, on it’s lonesome. For so strong was
the power of malice on land that no personification of grief, of
redemption could even come close to freeing the land from it’s eternal
grave.</p>

<p>Instead, it crafted not with the powers of the Ancients alone. It did
not build on raw emotion to free those entombed in raw emotion. It built
on hope, on glory, on redemption of course - but it built anew. It
looked westward.</p>

<p>From the west of the Silver Sea, in the deep black main that not even
its’ Silver could compare to, were storms not even the Lindwyrm could
survive. Seas of ghosts, of souls, of power unimaginable - not only of
the dead, but the powers of the living. And from there would it take
its’ new building blocks. From the storms it grasped power, fury,
dedication and determination. From the souls it ripped humanity,
ability, luck, prowess. And from the mortal plain it invited vessels to
host it’s power - and those who accepted were imbued with it’s very
essence. Yet that would not be enough to truly repent. Each vessel, each
new Child of the Silver Sea was not only imbued with these combined
powers, forged ashore, but christened with one final mark. A single tear
from their ocean mother, with it a section of it’s own grief - of it’s
own dedication.</p>

<p>On the ‘Eve of liberation, of redemption, the ranks of the Children
stood 1000 strong. 1000 folk, brought together willingly from the west,
clad in the finest steels and captaining the finest crafts, ready to
return the beauty of the land now lost, to wrest truth and
reconciliation out of the hands of lashing misery. Mordehai, first of
his name, great son of the Seas led the charge of his companions across
the Silver Sea, across the gulf, protected from the wrath of it’s waters
by the calm embrace of it’s patron, and made their way for the Solphyn
coast. All across his companions would land, to bring freedom to the
folk, and retribution to the rubble that was the lands’ remains. But
Mordehai’s goal was different. For at the Solphyn Coast, staring into
the dark embrace of the Silver Sea rose Hehlyng, a grim fortress of
blackened stone, scratching bloody murder into the clouds - an affront
against the ancient beauty he had come to restore, but not only; for it
was the seat of power for the Wyvern Cult alongside. It was the home of
the Lindywyrm. And to truly bring about redemption, it was this beast
that needed slaying.</p>

<p>With 370 at his back was the coast of the Hehlyng stormed, man ‘gainst
Wyvern, with blades of ancient silver steel piercing the hearts of
timeless names manifested in the winged abominations - and forever
destroyed from History. The battle would be legendary, with the
Retributors casting themselves ferociously against the Hehlyng like the
waves of a storm.</p>

<p>The battle was one of glory surrounded by terrible loss - for each
Sea-Wyrm struck down, 10 would give their eternal souls. Yet so went the
battle that as the moon rose above the twisted tower, Mordehai and his
most loyal retainers had clambered to the very final levels of the
Hehlyng - to face the Lindwyrm.</p>

<p>That which took place within the Hehlyng on that day is of a scale
visible to those who even eclipse the ancients. A true tale of hope
against destruction, the battle would form it’s very own legend. The
Hehlyng itself would be brought down and swallowed by the sea during the
course, as even the waves found themselves a belligerent in this epic.
Sunken back towards ground, the Retributors would face the Lindwyrm in
the open airs, it’s awful wings beating with the sound of death itself.
The Kelpies, who had fought against the Companions, would find
themselves enamored with their righteous cause, and turn coat against
their enslaving sky masters, serving as steeds for the final charge
against the Drowned God.</p>

<p>As the deed was done, the great beast - the Drowned God, would be slain.
For the 370 that embarked upon the capital of terror, only 20 would
remain. Amongst them would not be Mordehai, however. For his spear,
named Dawnbringer, and his steed, the Kelpie named Prince, would along
with him forever be lodged in the heart of the Lindwyrm, swallowed whole
by its - and the seas - eternal maw.</p>

<p>The battle would rage on for over a decade in the calendar of the
ancients, with the Wyverns brought first to heel and then to Hell with
their extinction. Their slaves, driven mad by their curse, would fight
for their tyrant masters, and with great grief would be driven out of
the coasts. Ancient beasts of terror would either be exterminated or
brought to bent knee to swear fealty to the new peace of the Silver Sea,
as the beauty of the land would once again be brought back. For their
conquests, the Retributors would be handed the claim over the coasts, to
found their own cities and kingdoms upon the shattered remains of the
ancient Wyvern Cult. On the ruins of the Hehlyng, upon the Solphyn Coast
would the First monument rise, and around it the first city - yet across
the entire territory, now blessed with the peace and protection of both
the land and the sea, would clans of glory establish their own states.
It is from here that the Vyasi originate, the heirs of the Companions,
of the Retributors - the far descendants of the Children of the Silver
Sea, beacons of Peace and Redemption - for better or worse. … Of
course, such illustrious chronicle seeps of naught but superstition and
tall tales; as does the founding myth of all the peoples of Samarah. And
just as, such little evidence remains that these events cannot be
separated from fiction - but they would not be made within this History
if they could so easily be separated from truth, too.</p>

<p>While not as magnanimous, migration records do indeed suggest the
original occupation of the lands that make up Vyasastan was from the
north - although their racial makeup was unknown. Be they human, elf,
dwarf or descendant of humanoid now left extinct, there is
archaeological evidence for these “natives” - just as there is evidence
for the potential of the mentioned ancient creatures, with bone records
of Wyverns possibly being discovered in Pehl as early as the 1760s, and
sightings of “kelpies” continuing to even to the present.</p>

<p>Equally so, there is record of a secondary migration from the west,
across the Silver Sea; although, of course, the status of these settlers
as “Children of an ancient godthing that took the shape, lived in or was
the Silver Sea” is of debate. What is certain, however, is that settlers
came from the north, established some basis of civilization - and were
later met by settlers from the west, whom conquered, became assimilated
or absorbed the natives themselves across the early Vyasi lands, and
would spark the beginning of Vyasi history. What is of interesting note,
however, is that while these unnamed natives - these legendary “servants
of the Wyvern Cult” lacked the written word or paper, they did leave
behind a small handful of structures, particularly in the north west of
the country. Amongst these key archaeological sites were, during their
study, found Runestones, with clear symbols of seeming relation in at
least context to what would become the alphabets of the Central Samarah
States. While translation of these materials is limited to say the
least, with their contents still best seen as speculation if not often
as complete fabrication, there is reference to “Sea Peoples”, invading
without warning.</p>

<p>What is of most note, however, is that in the one Runestone found
discussing this arrival, the term “human” is never used. While it can
easily be assumed that these natives, if they were not human themselves,
would simply not have this word in their vocabulary, it could just as
easily point to a more exotic background in the Vyasi - for in it’s
place is used the symbol, when translated into Vyasi, “Selkie” - or,
more commonly - Sea-elf.</p>

<h2 id="government">Government</h2>

<h3 id="national-ideology">National Ideology</h3>

<p>Vyasi Syndicalism has been the prevailing method of state government and
arrangement since 1045. Influenced by the environmental requirements of
the tundra and traditional monarchy from neighbouring societies,
Syndicalism espouses authoritarian governance from a trusted, elected
party on behalf of the reigning estates. Historically, this has
manifested as a system not dissimilar to an elective monarchy; with the
Syndic elected for life by the state Syndicate, a board of counsellors,
petty nobles and syndicalist advisors.</p>

<p>Modern Syndicalism finds its direct roots from the Syndicate of the
Glashtyn Plutocrate, wherein memebers of the Syndicate found alignment
through an individuals taxable income; with the syndicate being made up
of traders, lords of high development and the consorts of the ruling
Syndic. This theoretically ensured strict governance of the state in
relation to the production and wealth of its people, prioritizing the
incomes of the landed estates. Election of the Syndic themselves was
done by the members of the Veche, the most trusted and key advisors of
the total syndicate - as syndicate referred to the entire method of
governance including Syndic and personal retainers.</p>

<p>A major alteration to this method of rule was through the adoption of
the Social Charter in 1810. Anonymously and collaboratively written in
1805, the charter called for representation in the syndicate to be
extended to the average citizenry, alongside the adoption of free and
anonymous elections, positions on the syndicate to be paid, and the
establishment of constitutional powers in place of the complete control
of the Syndic. Importantly, this was not adopted - but the second
iteration of the Social Charter, penned with influence from the first by
Magister Integra in 1809, was.</p>

<p>The reformed Syndicate espoused the will and motivations of the people;
extending the election of members of the Syndicate to local career
politicians of any income to represent their local area, and putting
strict controls on the passage of new laws regarding agricultural
import, wages and health reform. However, this did not affect the
position of Syndic, who remained and remains the key head of state in
the passage of laws and maintaining diplomacy.</p>

<p>Modern Syndicalism is orchestrated by the Grand National Consolidated
Syndicate Congress, or SyndktKngrs for short. Split into the upper
house, the traditional Veche Syndicate of the Congress that provides
direct counsel and advice to the Syndic, and is home to the government
Magisters and Ministers that form the ruling government, appointed by
the Syndic through either recommendation by the lower house, the Chief
Magister or the Syndics personal choice. The General Syndicate houses
the people’s representatives to discuss, submit amendments and bring
forth local issues of the Vyasi constituencies. Seats are assigned via
population representation, with more representatives from more populated
powers. Alongside this, 10 seats are reserved for the leaders of the
various amalgamated workers Unions of Vyasastan, elected within the
union itself, 2 seats reserved for key Eudemonists of Stoicism and one
seat reserved for the Syndic themselves, in tradition forever abstaining
as they take control of the government itself.</p>

<p>Elected officials of the General Syndicate or the politicians of the
Veche must, as all other Vyasi citizens, pass the the Political National
Aptitude Test, but must similarly have an approved Syndicalist education
and pass the PNAT-Extended test to qualify for election and government
representation. This is to ensure Syndicate officials have the socialist
ideology of the people in mind when elected, and ensures representation
of the true will of the people in the despotic system without chance for
subversive ideologies to find voice in the Syndicate. This has been
criticised by international states concerned with democracy as forcibly
implementing a one party system in an already authoritarian government,
however such criticism has often been rebuked in Vyasastan as such
testing ensures only the most qualified to know what is best for the
people can lead.</p>

<h3 id="military">Military</h3>

<p>Kaganovich would be proud!</p>

<h3 id="notable-laws-and-governmental-matters">Notable laws and governmental matters</h3>

<p>There is no complete universal suffrage. Individuals of any nature may
vote, but only if their character is deemed cultured to respectable
Vyasi working class values, which is determined by participation and
membership in their local parish Political Club and successful passing
of a Political National Aptitude Test.</p>

<p>Squatting as an act is illegal, however due to an amendment in the
description of criminal activities passed in [TIME IS NOT REAL],
Criminals must be found to have a “sufficient deficiency of morality” or
“The knowledgeable malice of knowing their actions may cause criminal
distress” as a Mens Rea. As established in precedent through the case
Natanael v Parish of Pehl (1982), as a squatter can be deemed to not be
causing any moral crime and only either acting on human instincts of
desiring shelter and freedom, and not causing any harm if the building
is unoccupied or not in use, all charges of squatting can be dropped.
This does not prevent associated crimes, like unemployment, however.</p>

<h2 id="culture">Culture</h2>

<h3 id="phalansteries">Phalansteries</h3>

<p>The Phalanstery is one of the most common and unique pieces of
architecture unique to Vyasastan. Thought to have been invented
somewhere in the early 1910s, by 1930 the novel form of social housing
based equally around Utopian commune and ecological principles would
rapidly become commonplace throughout the nation; greatly influencing
city urbanization and almost replacing the concept of rural villages in
the countryside. The traditional Phalanstery took the form of a
self-contained, enclosed brick building in the shape of a multi-storied
rectangle with a central glass-roofed courtyard plaza for community
socialization and activities, with 3 dedicated housing wings holding
family-sized apartments accessible through the central courtyard. The
entrance wing, holding the street access into the Phalanstery, often
holds community service stations, such as a laundromat, religious
accommodation, and properties for co-operative establishments.</p>

<p>Phalansteries have 3 main architectural objectives:</p>

<p>As each Phalanstery would have only one or two entrances to the outside
with access to the interior shops and apartments restricted to being
exclusively through the interior plaza - while still having windows to
the outside - would mean any infantry force would be required to clear
each Phalanstery from the inside.</p>

<p>The invention of the Snowburn Engine in 1920, a mana-powered centralized
heating engine only further boosted the popularity of Phalanstery
construction, as it further incentivized architects and contractors to
simply re-use the industrial-scale Snowburn Engines used in factories to
power the 56 apartments of a Phalanstery rather than investing in
smaller and more expensive single-unit Engines. Coupled with the
invention of the Maxmillian Brickbenter in 1939 and the following Brick
Boom in architecture that saw factories, government buildings boom in
brick construction - Phalansteries became increasingly commonplace
across the nation, though not always to the same quality. Many
Phalansteries constructed for the housing of industrial factory workers
or in the impoverished parishes of cities would suffer greatly from lack
of maintenance leading to mildew or fungal growths, damages to the
brickwork or glasswork that would let the interior heat escape - not
mentioning the inherent issues of privacy when thinly constructed and
the cramped conditions for larger families. Nevertheless, Phalansteries
are still seen as a national icon and more often than not thought about
fondly, and to this day serve as the primary source of housing available
in Vyasastan.</p>

<h3 id="khloroflesh">Khloroflesh</h3>

<p>Khloroflesh, more commonly Chloroflesh, is s mana-induced condition in
which flora and general plant material begins developing on the body of
a living being, most notably affecting mammals and amphibians. Once
considered a strictly negative - if not debilitating - condition that
could potentially cause minor epidermal damage through the growth of
thorns and hardened plant matter throughout the limbs, or in rarer and
more pressing cases piercing even through internal organs- that was an
identifying mark of the poor and idle. “Those whom do not work and do
not provide are grown over in time as an unmoving rock is with moss”
would be the christening tenant spouted at those imbued with
Khloroflesh, and avoided as if a true plague.</p>

<p>Beginning in the industrial revolution, with the invention of easy if
painful cures and the growth of a middle class, Chloroflesh began to be
seen in a far more positive light being used as a form of body
modification and expressionism amongst both the intellectual and working
classes, with people often nurturing small rose coils around their arms,
flowering crown-bracelets, or even the practice of growing thin veins
down their arms becoming increasing common. Proper maintenance is of
course required.</p>

<p>While beginning as a rare, somewhat taboo and incredibly expressionist
piece of body modification, in the march of time Chloroflesh tattoos and
piercing found not only more common understanding and appreciation in
the public eye, but even found some degree of practical usage. Oakflesh,
a symptom of Chloroflesh in which the afflicted limbs develop rash-like
protrusions that, if nourished, take on the physical and chemical form
of tree bark, would come to be particularly sought out by those in
working class, industrial professions. Where more green-based
afflictions could suffer burns, damages and death in more taxing
environments like cotton mills, Oakflesh brought the benefit of not only
providing a piece of bodily expression that could be kept through the
work day (and even carved with intricate patterns, meaningful symbolism
or even simple notes with minimal pain) but being particularly useful in
such environments - where bare flesh would scar, cut, or burn, “Oakflesh
Gauntlets” could push forward with minimal pain or meaningful damage,
and would reportedly give the afflicted “the strength of the ancient
trees” to further work.</p>

<p>Outside of Vyasastan, opinion to Chloroflesh remains mainly negative,
often being seen mostly as a strange southern disease, or in some cases,
as agricultural heresy.</p>

<h3 id="cult-of-productivity">Cult of Productivity</h3>

<p>You remember that SCP that made people use their heads as hammers?</p>

<h3 id="lanpochshtel">Lanpochshtel</h3>

<p><img src="LogosLanpochstel1.png" title="LogosLanpochstel1.png" width="200" alt="LogosLanpochstel1.png" /> Each Parish is legally
obligated to operate a branch of the national post and telegraph union,
known more commonly as the Lanpochshtel, theoretically managed and
overseen by the National Board of the Lanpochshtel in Glashtyn as a
total national monopoly. This was originally designed to maintain and
complete and constant penny post service across the entire nation,
however due to the power of the Parish postal unions upon their
creations, many of these services tend to operate as their own
individual units. Competition may be realistically non-existent due to
the fact each branch of the Lanpochshtel has its jurisdiction limited to
the parish it was created in, but individual unions can compete within
the nationalized services on funding and - when parishes are redrawn -
for extensions in jurisdiction.</p>

<p>The Lanpochshtel, rather uncharacteristically for Vyasastan, is one of
the very few services across the country that works strangely well.
Almost too well. When pooling resources together, such as when packages
or telegrams being moved are property of the government, industry, or
massive companies that cross parish lines, goods can get from one end of
Vyasastan to the other with unexpected efficiency. This has,
unfortunately, led to the Lanpochshtel receiving more and more
international focus - and has recently began bidding on small postal
services and routes in other nations. The success of these ventures, as
of now, are currently unknown. Though successful on the large scale for
mass industry, consumer packages and goods tend to operate at the
razor-thin margin of standard service, with efficiency lowered due to
inter-parish paperwork for parcels and messages. While the rise of
digital media and messaging has seen the Lanpochshtel diminish in
service across the nation due to the 3D Printing of messages or simple
emails, the fact the Lanpochshtel is directly funded by the government
and still heavily required for the travel and transport of large scale
goods has largely meant it did not suffer as much as privatized post
services across the continent - only further increasing its unnerving
and nationalized lead in the industry of the post.</p>

<h3 id="non-human-populations-in-vyasastan">Non-Human Populations in Vyasastan</h3>

<p>Vyasastan’s majority population could, by some (mainly supremacist)
metrics, be by itself considered non-human. At the very least ab-human,
Vyasi humans have greater cold acclimation adaptions, with higher skin
and internal temperatures prompting greater metabolic adaptation,
expanding on natural insulation and generally expanded blood vessels.
Thought to have been either due to intermixing with the local races of
the far south or due to predisposed characteristics of the proto-Vyasi
populations that notably, rather than the standard human pathway through
Bangsalaya, arrived in Vyasastan through the Silver Sea. This allows for
greater settlement in the far south, unlike the neighbouring humanoid
populations of Recaria and Luger forced into more continental habitats.
The mutations experienced by the Vyasi are enough to warrant difference
from standard southern human varieties, but is usually not enough to
claim them as non-human.</p>

<p>Vyasastan is also home to many completely non-human populations, though
all maintain some degree of humanoid characteristics. Broadly covered in
various categories of “Otherfolk” in national censuses, Otherfolk
represent the combined half human half non-human descendants of many of
the indigenous populations of Vyasastan. By order of current population,
this includes half-Estries, descendant from the long-eared Estries of
the old south, Vaserni, piscine blue-hued humanoids and of course,
Lyashti. Most commonly referred to on the Internet as the famed “cat
people” or less affectionately as the “cat girls”, the large-bodied
Lyashti inhabit much of the south and southeast of Vyasastan, and are,
most unfortunately for the majority of tourists willing to trek all the
way out here, far larger in stature than expected by most travellers-
unless that is what is desired.</p>

<p>There exists also a small but incredibly notable population of Dwarfs in
Vyasastan. While not “native” to the country, the history of Dwarf
settlement and migration into the Silver Sea is long documented, being
largely integrated into common Vyasi society. Some esoteric historians
believe the majority of Vyasastan was owned by an ancient pre-historical
Dwarven civilization that was greatly displaced by the coming of the
Vyasi from the Silver Sea in the 800s, but this, largely, remains
unfounded.</p>

<h2 id="agriculture">Agriculture</h2>

<p>he Vyasi may be strangely well adapted to their umbral environment, but
the rest of standard human civilization hasn’t been keen on following
them into their icy, tundra-laden grave. Thus, many of their standard
practices, even in this modern, industrialized age, differ greatly from
their neighbouring cousins - not least of which is the field of
agriculture. Little grows in the permafrost, and even less of that is
edible.</p>

<h3 id="fishing">Fishing</h3>

<p>Early Vyasi societies conspired primarily in small huddles around
fishing villages, living exclusively of the Silver Sea and its’ Piscine
Bounty. While with sprawling cities, factories, and industrial food
practices very little are left to such a meager existence, Fishing is
still a primary staple of the average folk, from commercial fishing
across the carved out lakes and seas of Vyasastan to industrial
fish-farming to every level in-between.</p>

<h3 id="algaculture">Algaculture</h3>

<p>Lacking a primary food crop does not mean Vyasastan lacks crop farming.
Instead, the cultivated diet of the Vyasi consists mainly of rugged
flora that, where discarded by other cultures, has been viciously
selectively shifted into a nutrient source by the tenacious (or spiteful
to their environment, depending on who you ask) Vyasi throughout
history. One of the most prevalent of these alternate methods is a
reliance on Algae and water plants. being able to live and thrive even
in frozen over bodies of water, some species even experiencing
heightened productivity on the underside of ice. While already a beacon
of plant productivity in the relatively barren wastes of the tundra
bioregion, when introduced to human cultivation, with nitrogen and
phosphorous fertilization and selective breeding, Algaculture equals
agriculture even in the most fertile of black soils. The Kelp Fields of
Lake Pendrakhyn have even become a minor tourist attraction, to the
minor annoyance of their farmers. Goes well with salted meats and fish.</p>

<h3 id="razormoss">Razormoss</h3>

<p>The saying may be that the Vyasi descend from the sea, but that doesn’t
mean they eschew the land they live on. While the tundra has naught but
a lukewarm response to plants, with only low-lying shrubland being all
that is available once one leaves the taiga forests of Vyasastan, it
would be strange if there wasn’t a Vyasi crop which went against nature
in spite and thrived. Most common of these, and the most important of
such domesticated plants, is Razormoss.</p>

<p>Mezermokh in Vyasi, Razormoss is a genus of tundra mosses commonly found
growing across the majority of Vyasastan, including he Kaltshetekh - the
most frigid south. Taking the appearance of a large, green blanket, it
is most suitable to absorbing the nutrients of the wet soil of the
tundra, covering soil and stone alike. What makes Razormoss most
distinct, however, is the almost anomalous nature of its’ rhizoids - the
anchoring semi-roots of most moss species. While rhizoids are naturally
strong in order to cling on to harsh surfaces, Razormoss rhizoids
display an unparalleled strength sharpness and, most concerning, dogged
determination.</p>

<p>What stops the majority of rooted and large plants from growing in the
tundra is the thick layer of permafrost under the topsoil, unavailable
for plants to dig through. Thus, plants that require large rootspace and
the nutrients such roots would provide simply do not survive. This is
not an issue for Razormoss. Through a process described as “natural
drilling” or “a physical form of erosion” known as plant-shattering,
razormoss rhizoids manage to, in time, break through the permafrost -
and keep going. This not only allows for the moss to grow to an
exponential size, but allows it to tap into the trapped resources and
nutrients of the permafrost - and even to frozen reservoirs of mana.
This plant shattering displaces the permafrost and allows for the soil
to rest, allowing for larger plants to follow suit once the frost is
cleared. The roots reportedly taste strangely of beef jerky.</p>

<h3 id="glensarn-herding">Glensarn Herding</h3>

<p><img src="Glensarn_diagram.png" title="Glensarn_diagram.png" width="200" alt="Glensarn_diagram.png" /> The tundra and taiga are home to a wild
flurry of animals both small and large, ferocious and docile, fearful
and stubborn. Many of them have roots in magical beasts, their status as
monsters dissipated through nature. Glensarnel stand somewhere at the
crossroads of all these categories. Of relation to the more common
species of deer, reindeer, elk and moose from across Samarah, yet
resembling more the ancient Ice-Age remnants of such a genus than any
commonly alive ancestors, as if by some force the very ancestors were
brought back to graze once more. Largely passive herbivores, yet highly
stubborn and known to become aggressive even to predators double their
strength. Growing sizable and expansive tusks rather than antlers, they
are the stars of many an ancient and mystical Vyasi tale, and equally
the stars of their dinnerplates.</p>

<p>Glensarn herding and ranching is a key component of Vyasi agriculture
due to their many, many uses. With heavy, warm fur they provide the base
material for many an authentic Vyasi coat - their extended and strong
bones going from the building blocks of ancient Vyasi bone tools to
still even now respected ornaments - and most importantly, their meat,
which soothes hunger across the Commonwealth. The peacefully belligerent
nature of Glensarnel prevent any meaningful efforts to fatten up a
Glensarn for selective breeding, ensuring the meat retains a solid,
muscly texture, but this has largely been accepted as a staple of the
Vyasi diet; not to mention the cost reduction in defending such a herd
when they remain fit enough to kill of their own volition, and the fact
they make for excellent pack and farmhand animals - though aren’t
recommended to be ridden. The fauna of Vyasastan has faced hunts galore
for their meat and furs, and the Glensarnel has seen this more than any
other species in these ancient frozen woods. Industrial herding and
ranching practices have only made such a fate even worse in modern
times. Yet they remain a well-respected beast of shared burden in the
eternal tundra, and are rarely mocked - especially if their mythological
explanations ring true.</p>
