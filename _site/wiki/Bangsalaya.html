<p>The first settlements began around nine thousand years ago, beginning
with tribes and city-states that gradually developed into bigger
polities. During the 2nd century BCE, most of these settlements were
slowly united by the fae Saccam dynasty through the evangelization of
Arwethanism, a native religion that started with the Veda textbooks,
however most of their territory was later conquered by the Taglaw. The
Lakan empire was one of the world’s longest-lasting empires, spanning
for just less than a millennium, ultimately collapsing into various
successor states due to depleted mana resources and the resulting crisis
afterwards.</p>

<p>Northern colonialism began as early as the 17th century, starting with
the Malaszec empire in present-day Mijikaya, although foreign influence
was present even prior. The Urendir empire then followed after in the
southern half of the country. Shortly after the</p>
<Malaszeci-Erothenan war=""> which united all present-day territories, a
new national identity emerged, culminating in the Bangsalayan Revolution
in 1934, with formal independence recognized 6 years later.

The Bangsalayan economy is one of the region’s largest and
fastest-growing, having rapidly risen since the 1990s. It is
highly-diversified, with its leading sectors being mana refinery,
services, and trade. It is a member of the Samaran Council and the
G<number>, and an associate member of the Southern League.
