<p>The International Social Credit System (ISCS) is an international
reputation system that keeps track of individuals’ reputation using a
social credit score. The ISCS was created in 2 July 2051, with national
governments and influential corporations in the <a href="International_Regulations_and_Standards_Body" title="wikilink">International
Regulations and Standards
Body</a> as
founding members. Each individual’s social credit score is stored in a
private blockchain; the public is allowed to read social credit scores,
but only ISCS members are allowed to modify social credit scores.
Members may modify an individual’s social credit score for any number of
reasons, including for crimes committed by that person or failure to
repay debts. Entities can use this social credit score to determine
things like what services to provide an individual, whether they can
board planes, or immigration status.</p>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>Trials for the first social credit system started in
<a href="K'ahjaan" title="wikilink">K’ahjaan</a> in 2039. The social credit system was
national in scope and was universally adopted nationwide in 2049. The
success of the K’ahjaan social credit system pushed other governments to
develop their own. Overtime, many forms of social credit were formed,
but for purposes of immigration and the global market, the variety of
competing standards made it difficult to transfer social credit from one
system to another. This led to the creation of the ISCS in 2 July 2051,
establishing a worldwide, decentralized, and standardized database.</p>

<h2 id="blockchain">Blockchain</h2>

<p>The ISCS uses a blockchain, or decentralized ledger, to store social
credit scores. The benefit of the blockchain is that there is no central
authority that needs to be trusted. Each transaction, which can be a
change to an individual’s social credit score or the creation of an
individual’s score, is collected into blocks. Nodes broadcast their
transactions to every other node, and each node collects these
transactions into blocks. A randomly chosen node submits a block to be
added to the blockchain, and the other nodes vote on whether to add the
block to the blockchain.</p>

<p>The voting-based consensus differs from proof-based consensus algorithms
used by cryptocurrencies, where nodes are given the ability to add
blocks based on whether they solve a cryptographic problem first.
Voting-based consensus is used in ISCS because the identities of all
nodes that are allowed to add blocks are known. Votes cannot be
falsified because each other member has the public key of every other
member, which is used to verify that a vote comes from a certain member.
Voting-based consensus has the advantage of adding blocks faster, and
nodes cannot hijack the blockchain by accumulating the majority of the
computing power of the blockchain (known as the 51% attack).</p>
