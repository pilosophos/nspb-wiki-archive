# The NSPB Canon Wiki Archive
This is an archive of the NSPB Canon Wiki (formerly hosted at the now defunct `nspbcanon.miraheze.org`). It was created from a [Wiki dump](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:DumpBackup.php) of the original wiki taken on October 8, 2023. The original [main page](wiki/Main_Page) can be found [here](wiki/Main_Page).

Certain content available in the original wiki was not preserved in the dump and is therefore absent from this archive:
- Author names
- Old versions and revisions of pages
- Templates, infoboxes, and certain formatting
- Autogenerated pages, such as category indexes
